# Recovery Plan

## What Happened

During the reorganization, the original files were accidentally deleted when removing the nested folder structure. The files should be recoverable from Google Drive's trash.

## Recovery Options

### Option 1: Restore from Google Drive Trash (Recommended)

1. Go to Google Drive web interface
2. Click on "Trash" in the left sidebar
3. Find the "Mantra" folder
4. Right-click and select "Restore"
5. The folder will be restored to `/Users/mb16/My Drive (koosha.g@gmail.com)/code/Mantra`
6. Then we can properly move it to `/Users/mb16/My Drive (koosha.g@gmail.com)/code/mantra`

### Option 2: Recreate from Scratch

I have all the code and can recreate the entire project structure. This would take about 10-15 minutes and would include:

- All source files (data_extractor.py, indexer.py, query_classifier.py, response_generator.py)
- All scripts and tests
- All documentation
- Configuration files (pyproject.toml, .env.example, .gitignore)
- The complete uv-based structure

## Recommended Action

**Please restore the folder from Google Drive trash first.** This is the quickest and safest option.

Once restored, I can help you:
1. Move it to the clean `/code/mantra` location
2. Remove any references to "windsurf" or "CascadeProjects"
3. Ensure everything is working properly

## If Restoration Fails

If the files cannot be restored from trash, I can recreate everything. Just let me know and I'll rebuild the entire project structure with all the code we developed.
