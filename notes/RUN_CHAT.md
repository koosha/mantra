# How to Run the Chat Widget

## âœ… Simple 2-Step Process

### Step 1: Open Terminal

Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd "/Users/mb16/My Drive (koosha.g@gmail.com)/code/mantra"
```

### Step 2: Run This Command

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate && python3 chat_api.py
```

**That's it!** The server will start and show you:
```

## âœ‹ If You Get "Address in Use" Error
